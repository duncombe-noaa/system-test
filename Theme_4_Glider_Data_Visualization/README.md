# IOOS System Test - Theme 4 - Glider Data Visualization

This scenario tests if we can find glider data and demonstrate visualization of a few profiles. We will also try to see how much data is getting through to the DAC.

This theme was started by 

- opening a iPython notebook locally on a Windows 7 computer with Anaconda, 
- creating a new notebook, 
- and filling in cells appropriately.
- Transitioned to working from the AWS VM once that was set up.





Glider data can be found at
