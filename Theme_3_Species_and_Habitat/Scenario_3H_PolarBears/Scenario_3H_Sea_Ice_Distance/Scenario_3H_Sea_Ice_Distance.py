# ## Exploring Environmental Changes Affecting Polar Bears, part 2: Sea Ice Distance from Shore
# 
# ## Questions
# 1. Can we discover, access and map the sea ice edge using NSIDC passive microwave satellite data?
# 2. Can we discover, access and map the US and Canada distribution of polar bears from the Arctic Marine Synthesis, or some other source?
# 3. Can we discover, access and map the Beaufort Sea coastline of Alaska and Canada, where Polar Bears are known to reside?
# 4. What is the minimum distance between the shoreline containing known polar bear distributions and the closest sea ice edge through time?
# 5. Are certain sections of the coastline more susceptible to long distances from sea ice?
